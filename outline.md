"The Ongoing Evolution of OpenMP"

1. Intro
  A. History of spec releases -- tom skeleton, maybe tim?
2. Philosophy - mission statement
  A. Serial equivalence
  B. Performance/parallelization annotations
  C. Language independence (do vs for, callback to history?) -- tim?
  D. Relationship to the base language code? Restrictions?
  E. More? Turing complete?
3. Concepts and Mechanics
  A. Outlining
  B. Data environments/privatization -- alex, maybe merge with the next one?
  C. Scoping / ICVs
4. Recent extensions
  A. 4.0 & 4.5
  B. devices
  C. SIMD -- alex
  D. maybe some misc.? Iterators? -- alex, probably move to future, feel free to
                                           add other future stuff
5. Future directions 
  A. Device extensions
  B. Normative language standards
  C. Supporting language-level outlining (lambdas): 
    I. directives across contexts
    II. Lambda in other languages, tasks with handles?
  D. More parallelism models?
6. Conclusion
