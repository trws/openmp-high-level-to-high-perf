	Abstract = {Current and next generation HPC systems will exploit accelerators and self-hosting devices within their compute nodes to accelerate applications. This comes at a time when programmer productivity and the ability to produce portable code has been recognized as a major concern. One of the goals of OpenMP and OpenACC is to allow the user to specify parallelism via directives so that compilers can generate device specific code and optimizations. However, the challenge of porting codes becomes more complex because of the different types of parallelism and memory hierarchies available on different architectures. In this paper we discuss our experience with porting the SPEC ACCEL benchmarks from OpenACC to OpenMP 4.5 using a performance portable style that lets the compiler make platform-specific optimizations to achieve good performance on a variety of systems. The ported SPEC ACCEL OpenMP benchmarks were validated on different platforms including Xeon Phi, GPUs and CPUs. We believe that this experience can help the community and compiler vendors understand how users plan to write OpenMP 4.5 applications in a performance portable style.},

	Abstract = {Through the algorithmic design patterns of data parallelism and task parallelism, the graphics processing unit (GPU) offers the potential to vastly accelerate discovery and innovation across a multitude of disciplines. For example, the exponential growth in data volume now presents an obstacle for high-throughput data mining in fields such as neuroscience and bioinformatics. As such, we present a characterization of a MapReduced-based data-mining application on a general-purpose GPU (GPGPU). Using neuroscience as the application vehicle, the results of our multi-dimensional performance evaluation show that a ldquoone-size-fits-allrdquo approach maps poorly across different GPGPU cards. Rather, a high-performance implementation on the GPGPU should factor in the 1) problem size, 2) type of GPU, 3) type of algorithm, and 4) data-access method when determining the type and level of parallelism. To guide the GPGPU programmer towards optimal performance within such a broad design space, we provide eight general performance characterizations of our data-mining application. View full abstract},

These benchmarks consist of five "parallel kernel" benchmarks and three "simulated application" benchmarks. Together they mimic the computation and data movement characteristics of large scale computational fluid dynamics applications.

@inproceedings{Banerjee:2006be,
	Abstract = {Next-generation e-science applications will require the ability to transfer information at high data rates between distributed computing centers and data repositories. To support such applications, lambda grid networks have been built to provide large, on-demand bandwidth between end-points that are interconnected via optical circuit-switched lambdas. It is extremely important to develop an efficient transport protocol over such high-capacity, dedicated circuits. Because lambdas provide dedicated bandwidth between endpoints, they obviate the need for network congestion control. Consequently, past research has demonstrated that rate-based transport protocols, such as RBUDP, are more effective than TCP in transferring data over lambdas. However, while lambdas eliminate congestion in the network, they ultimately push the congestion to the endpoints - congestion that current rate-based transport protocols are ill-suited to handle. In this paper we introduce a "rate-adaptive protocol for intelligent delivery (RAPID)" of data that is lightweight and end-system performance-aware, so as to maximize end-to-end throughput while minimizing packet loss. Based on self monitoring of the dynamic task-priority at the receiving end-system, our protocol enables the receiver to proactively deliver feedback to the sender, so that the sender may adapt its sending rate to avoid congestion at the receiving end-system. This avoids large bursts of packet losses typically observed in current rate-based transport protocols. Over a 10-Gigabit link emulation of an optical circuit, RAPID reduces file-transfer time, and hence improves end-to-end throughput by as much as 25\%},

	Abstract = {OpenMP has emerged as an important model and language extension for shared-memory parallel programming. On shared-memory platforms, OpenMP offers an intuitive, incremental approach to parallel programming. In this paper, we present techniques that extend the ease of shared-memory parallel programming in OpenMP to distributed-memory platforms as well. First, we describe a combined compile-time/runtime system that uses an underlying software distributed shared memory system and exploits repetitive data access behavior in both regular and irregular program sections. We present a compiler algorithm to detect such repetitive data references and an API to an underlying software distributed shared memory system to orchestrate the learning and proactive reuse of communication patterns. Second, we introduce a direct translation of standard OpenMP into MPI message-passing programs for execution on distributed memory systems. We present key concepts and describe techniques to analyze and efficiently handle both regular and irregular accesses to shared data. Finally, we evaluate the performance achieved by our approaches on representative OpenMP applications. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {This paper describes extensions to OpenMP that implemen data placemen features needed for NUMA architectures. OpenMP is a collection of compiler directives and library routines used to write portable parallel programs for shared-memory architectures. Writing efficient parallel programs for NUMA architectures, which have characteristics of both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures, requires that a programmer control the placement of data in memory and the placement of computations that operate on that data. Optimal performance is obtained when computations occur on processors that have fast access to the data needed by those computations. OpenMP-designed for shared-memory architectures-does not by itself address these issues. The extensions to OpenMP Fortran presented here have been mainly taken from High Performance Fortran. The paper describes some of the techniques that the Compaq Fortran compiler uses to generate efficient code based on these extensions. I also describes some additional compiler optimizations, and concludes with some preliminary results. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {With the advent of next-generation high throughput sequencing instruments, large volumes of short sequence data are generated at an unprecedented rate. Processing and analyzing these massive data requires overcoming several challenges including mapping of generated short sequences to a reference genome. This computationally intensive process takes time on the order of days using existing sequential techniques on large scale datasets. In this work, we propose six parallelization methods to speedup short sequence mapping and to reduce the execution time under just a few hours for such large datasets. We comparatively present these methods and give theoretical cost models for each method. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel methods and indicate that the cost models help accurate estimation of parallel execution time. Based on these cost models we implemented a selection function to predict the best method for a given scenario. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on parallelization of short sequence mapping problem.},

	Abstract = {The computational power provided by many-core graphics processing units (GPUs) has been exploited in many applications. The programming techniques currently employed on these GPUs are not sufficient to address problems exhibiting irregular, and unbalanced workload. The problem is exacerbated when trying to effectively exploit multiple GPUs concurrently, which are commonly available in many modern systems. In this paper, we propose a task-based dynamic load-balancing solution for single-and multi-GPU systems. The solution allows load balancing at a finer granularity than what is supported in current GPU programming APIs, such as NVIDIA's CUDA. We evaluate our approach using both micro-benchmarks and a molecular dynamics application that exhibits significant load imbalance. Experimental results with a single-GPU configuration show that our fine-grained task solution can utilize the hardware more efficiently than the CUDA scheduler for unbalanced workload. On multi-GPU systems, our solution achieves near-linear speedup, load balance, and significant performance improvement over techniques based on standard CUDA APIs.},

	Abstract = {Cross-species chromosome alignments can reveal ancestral relationships and may be used to identify the peculiarities of the species. It is thus an important problem in Bioinformatics. So far, aligning huge sequences, such as whole chromosomes, with exact methods has been regarded as unfeasible, due to huge computing and memory requirements. However, high performance computing platforms such as GPUs are being able to change this scenario, making it possible to obtain the exact result for huge sequences in reasonable time. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a parallel algorithm that uses GPU to align huge sequences, executing the Smith-Waterman algorithm combined with Myers-Miller, with linear space complexity. In order to achieve that, we propose optimizations that are able to reduce significantly the amount of data processed and that enforce full parallelism most of the time. Using the GTX 285 Board, our algorithm was able to produce the optimal alignment between sequences composed of 33 Millions of Base Pairs (MBP) and 47 MBP in 18.5 hours.},

@inproceedings{Frangieh:2010ky,
	Abstract = {Reconfigurable hardware development and debugging tools aspire to provide software-like productivity. A major impediment, however, is the lack of a module linkage capability permitting hardware blocks to be compiled concurrently, limiting the effective use of multi-core and multiprocessor platforms. Although modular and incremental design flows can reuse the layouts of unmodified blocks, non-local changes to the logical hierarchy or physical layout, or addition of debug circuitry, generally force complete re-implementation. We describe the PATIS dynamic floorplanner, targeting development environments in which some circuit speed and area optimization may be sacrificed for improved implementation and debug turnaround. The floorplan consists of partial modules with structured physical interfaces observable through configuration readback rather than synthesized logic analysis circuitry, allowing module ports to be passively probed without disturbing the layout. Although PATIS supports incremental design, complete re-implementation is still rapid because the partial bitstream for each block is generated by independent and concurrent invocations of the standard Xilinx tools running on separate cores or hosts. A continuous background task proactively generates floorplan variants to accelerate global layout changes. The partial reconfiguration design flow is easier to automate in PATIS because run-time module swapping is not required, suggesting that partial reconfiguration may serve a useful role in large-scale static design.},

	Abstract = {Recent accelerators such as GPUs achieve better cost-performance and watt-performance ratio, while the range of their application is more limited than general CPUs. Thus heterogeneous clusters and supercomputers equipped both with accelerators and general CPUs are becoming popular, such as LANL's Roadrunner and our own TSUBAME supercomputer. Under the assumption that many applications will run both on CPUs and accelerators but with varying speed and power consumption characteristics, we propose a task scheduling scheme that optimize overall energy consumption of the system. We model task scheduling in terms of the scheduling makespan and energy to be consumed for each scheduling decision. We define acceleration factor to normalize the effect of acceleration per each task. The proposed scheme attempts to improve energy efficiency by effectively adjusting the schedule based on the acceleration factor. Although in the paper we adopted the popular EDP (Energy-Delay Product) as the optimization metric, our scheme is agnostic on the optimization function. Simulation studies on various sets of tasks with mixed acceleration factors, the overall makespan closely matched the theoretical optimal, while the energy consumption was reduced up to 13.8\%.},

@inproceedings{huang-hppac09-gpu,
	Abstract = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as a computational accelerator that dramatically reduces the time to discovery in high-end computing (HEC). However, while today's state-of-the-art GPU can easily reduce the execution time of a parallel code by many orders of magnitude, it arguably comes at the expense of significant power and energy consumption. For example, the NVIDIA GTX 280 video card is rated at 236 watts, which is as much as the rest of a compute node, thus requiring a 500-W power supply. As a consequence, the GPU has been viewed as a ldquonon-greenrdquo computing solution. This paper seeks to characterize, and perhaps debunk, the notion of a ldquopower-hungry GPUrdquo via an empirical study of the performance, power, and energy characteristics of GPUs for scientific computing. Specifically, we take an important biological code that runs in a traditional CPU environment and transform and map it to a hybrid CPU+GPU environment. The end result is that our hybrid CPU+GPU environment, hereafter referred to simply as GPU environment, delivers an energy-delay product that is multiple orders of magnitude better than a traditional CPU environment, whether unicore or multicore.

	Abstract = {The TOP500 is a treasure trove of information on the leading edge of high performance computing. It was used in the 2008 DARPA Exascale technology report to isolate out the effects of architecture and technology on high performance computing, and lay the groundwork to project how current systems might mature through the coming years. Two particular classes of architectures were identified: "heavyweight" (based on high end commodity microprocessors) and "lightweight," (primarily BlueGene variants), and projections made on performance, concurrency, memory capacity, and power. This paper updates those projections, and adds a third class of "heterogeneous" architectures (leveraging the emerging class of GPU-like chips) to the mix. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) are promising parallel platforms for high performance computing. The CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming model provides improved programmability for general computing on GPGPUs. However, its unique execution model and memory model still pose significant challenges for developers of efficient GPGPU code. This paper proposes a new programming interface, called OpenMPC, which builds on OpenMP to provide an abstraction of the complex CUDA programming model and offers high-level controls of the involved parameters and optimizations. We have developed a fully automatic compilation and user-assisted tuning system supporting OpenMPC. In addition to a range of compiler transformations and optimizations, the system includes tuning capabilities for generating, pruning, and navigating the search space of compilation variants. Our results demonstrate that OpenMPC offers both programmability and tunability. Our system achieves 88\% of the performance of the hand-coded CUDA programs. View full abstract},

@inproceedings{Meng:2012fl,
	Abstract = {Applications often have a sequence of parallel operations to be offloaded to graphics processors; each operation can become an individual GPU kernel. Developers typically explore a variety of transformations for each kernel. Furthermore, it is well known that efficient data management is critical in achieving high GPU performance and that "fusing" multiple kernels into one may greatly improve data locality. Doing so, however, requires transformations across multiple, potentially nested, parallel loops; at the same time, the original code semantics and data dependency must be preserved. Since each kernel may have distinct data access patterns, their combined dataflow can be nontrivial. As a result, the complexity of multi-kernel transformations often leads to significant effort with no guarantee of performance benefits. This paper proposes a dataflow-driven analytical framework to project GPU performance for a sequence of parallel operations. Users need only provide CPU code skeletons for a sequence of parallel loops. The framework can then automatically identify opportunities for multi-kernel transformations and data management. It is also able to project the overall performance without implementing GPU code or using physical hardware. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the performance implications of data placement in OpenMP programs running on modern ccNUMA multiprocessors. Data locality and minimization of the rate of remote memory accesses are critical for sustaining high performance on these systems. We show that due to the low remote-to-local memory access latency ratio of state-of-the-art ccNUMA architectures, reasonably balanced page placement schemes, such as round-robin or random distribution of pages incur modest performance losses. We also show that performance leaks stemming from suboptimal page placement schemes can be remedied with a smart user-level page migration engine. The main body of the paper describes how the OpenMP runtime environment can use page migration for implementing implicit data distribution and redistribution schemes without programmer intervention. Our experimental results support the effectiveness of these mechanisms and provide a proof of concept that there is no need to introduce data distribution directives in OpenMP and warrant the portability of the programming model.

	Abstract = {Buffered coscheduling is a scheduling methodology for time-sharing communicating processes in parallel and distributed systems. The methodology has two primary features: communication buffering and strobing. With communication buffering, communication generated by each processor is buffered and performed at the end of regular intervals to amortize communication and scheduling overhead. This infrastructure is then leveraged by a strobing mechanism to perform a total exchange of information at the end of each interval, thus providing global information to more efficiently schedule communicating processes. This paper describes how buffered coscheduling can optimize resource utilization by analyzing workloads with varying computational granularities, load imbalances, and communication patterns. The experimental results, performed using a detailed simulation model, show that buffered coscheduling is very effective on fast SANs such as Myrinet as well as slower switch-based LANs View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Power is now a first-order design constraint in large-scale parallel computing. Used carefully, dynamic voltage scaling can execute parts of a program at a slower CPU speed to achieve energy savings with a relatively small (possibly zero) time delay. However, the problem of when to change frequencies in order to optimize energy savings is NP-complete, which has led to many heuristic energy-saving algorithms. To determine how closely these algorithms approach optimal savings, we developed a system that determines a bound on the energy savings for an application. Our system uses a linear programming solver that takes as inputs the application communication trace and the cluster power characteristics and then outputs a schedule that realizes this bound. We apply our system to three scientific programs, two of which exhibit load imbalance---particle simulation and UMT2K. Results from our bounding technique show particle simulation is more amenable to energy savings than UMT2K.},

	Abstract = {Heterogeneous systems with CPUs and computational accelerators such as GPUs, FPGAs or the upcoming Intel MIC are becoming mainstream. In these systems, peak performance includes the performance of not just the CPUs but also all available accelerators. In spite of this fact, the majority of programming models for heterogeneous computing focus on only one of these. With the development of Accelerated Open MP for GPUs, both from PGI and Cray, we have a clear path to extend traditional Open MP applications incrementally to use GPUs. The extensions are geared toward switching from CPU parallelism to GPU parallelism. However they do not preserve the former while adding the latter. Thus computational potential is wasted since either the CPU cores or the GPU cores are left idle. Our goal is to create a runtime system that can intelligently divide an accelerated Open MP region across all available resources automatically. This paper presents our proof-of-concept runtime system for dynamic task scheduling across CPUs and GPUs. Further, we motivate the addition of this system into the proposed Open MP for Accelerators standard. Finally, we show that this option can produce as much as a two-fold performance improvement over using either the CPU or GPU alone. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Multi-core architectures have spurred the rapid growth in high-end computing systems. While the vast majority of such multi-core processors contain symmetric hardware components, their interaction with systems software, in particular the communication stack, results in a remarkable amount of asymmetry in the effective capability of the different cores. In this paper, we analyze such interactions and propose a novel management library called SyMMer (Systems Mapping Manager) that monitors these interactions and dynamically manages the mapping of processes on processor cores to transparently improve application performance. Together with a detailed description of the SyMMer library, we also present performance evaluation comparing SyMMer to a vanilla communication library using various micro-benchmarks as well as popular applications and scientific libraries. Experimental results demonstrate more than a two-fold improvement in communication time and 10-15\% improvement in overall application performance.},

	Abstract = {A compare-and-swap shared-queue algorithm is presented that permits concurrent access. This algorithm is nondelaying in that no processor need wait for an action by another processor. A verification method that analyzes the states of the shared data structure is given. By drawing a graph that incorporates in a simple way the effects of multiprocessor interleaving, one can quickly find errors in an algorithm or produce a proof of correctness. Since enqueue and dequeue operations may begin at any time, concurrent queue operations are represented by providing, in each state of the shared data structure, one transition that initiates an enqueue operation and another transition for a dequeue operation. The method is a practical one that is applicable to a variety of algorithms that use shared data structures View full abstract},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the challenges in implementing a message passing interface usable on systems with data-parallel processors. As a case study, we design and implement the ldquoDCGNrdquo API on NVIDIA GPUs that is similar to MPI and allows full access to the underlying architecture. We introduce the notion of data-parallel thread-groups as a way to map resources to MPI ranks. We use a method that also allows the data-parallel processors to run autonomously from user-written CPU code. In order to facilitate communication, we use a sleep-based polling system to store and retrieve messages. Unlike previous systems, our method provides both performance and flexibility. By running a test suite of applications with different communication requirements, we find that a tolerable amount of overhead is incurred, somewhere between one and five percent depending on the application, and indicate the locations where this overhead accumulates. We conclude that with innovations in chipsets and drivers, this overhead will be mitigated and provide similar performance to typical CPU-based MPI implementations while providing fully-dynamic communication.},

	Abstract = {Procurement and the optimized utilization of Petascale supercomputers and centers is a renewed national priority. Sustained performance and availability of such large centers is a key technical challenge significantly impacting their usability. Storage systems are known to be the primary fault source leading to data unavailability and job resubmissions. This results in reduced center performance, partially due to the lack of coordination between I/O activities and job scheduling. In this work, we propose the coordination of job scheduling with data staging/offloading and on-demand staged data reconstruction to address the availability of job input data and to improve center-wide performance. Fundamental to both mechanisms is the efficient management of transient data: in the way it is scheduled and recovered. Collectively, from a center's standpoint, these techniques optimize resource usage and increase its data/service availability. From a user's standpoint, they reduce the job turnaround time and optimize the allocated time usage.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we characterize and analyze an increasingly popular style of programming for the GPU called Persistent Threads (PT). We present a concise formal definition for this programming style, and discuss the difference between the traditional GPU programming style (nonPT) and PT, why PT is attractive for some high-performance usage scenarios, and when using PT may or may not be appropriate. We identify limitations of the nonPT style and identify four primary use cases it could be useful in addressing-CPU-GPU synchronization, load balancing/irregular parallelism, producer-consumer locality, and global synchronization. Through micro-kernel benchmarks we show the PT approach can achieve up to an order-of-magnitude speedup over nonPT kernels, but can also result in performance loss in many cases. We conclude by discussing the hardware and software fundamentals that will influence the development of Persistent Threads as a programming style in future systems. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Bioinformaticists use the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to characterize an unknown sequence by comparing it against a database of known sequences, thus detecting evolutionary relationships and biological properties. mpiBLAST is a widely-used, high-performance, open-source parallelization of BLAST that runs on a computer cluster delivering super-linear speedups. However, the Achilles heel of mpiBLAST is its lack of modularity, thus adversely affecting maintainability and extensibility. Alleviating this shortcoming requires an architectural refactoring to improve maintenance and extensibility while preserving high performance. Toward that end, this paper evaluates five different software architectures and details how each satisfies our design objectives. In addition, we introduce a novel approach to using mixin layers to enable mixing-and-matching of modules in constructing sequence-search applications for a variety of high-performance computing systems. Our design, which we call "mixin layers with refined roles", utilizes mixin layers to separate functionality into complementary modules and the refined roles in each layer improve the inherently modular design by precipitating flexible and structured parallel development, a necessity for an open-source application. We believe that this new software architecture for mpiBLAST-2.0 will benefit both the users and developers of the package and that our evaluation of different software architectures will be of value to other software engineers faced with the challenges of creating maintainable and extensible, high-performance, bioinformatics software.

We call our scheme GREEN-MH. We envision deploying GREEN-MH at an institutional gateway in the context of a larger multi-hop and multi-bottleneck network environment. GREEN-MH uses a dynamic buffer-accounting algorithm on a per-flow basis such that certain edge-based fairness policies (e.g., max-min and proportional) are enforced among the competing TCP flows.},

	Abstract = {A recent study shows that computation per kilowatt-hour has doubled every 1.57 years, akin to Moore's Law. While this trend is encouraging, its implications to high-performance computing (HPC) are not yet clear. For instance, DARPA's target of a 20-MW exaflop system will require a 56.8-fold performance improvement with only a 2.4-fold increase in power consumption, which seems unachievable in light of the above trend. To provide a more comprehensive perspective, we analyze current trends in energy efficiency from the Green500 and project expectations for the near future. Specifically, we first provide an analysis of energy efficiency trends in HPC systems from the Green500. We then model and forecast the energy efficiency of future HPC systems. Next, we present exascalar - a holistic metric to measure the distance from the exaflop goal. Finally, we discuss our efforts to standardize power measurement methodologies in order to provide the community with reliable and accurate efficiency data. View full abstract},

@inproceedings{Bauer:2012ku,
	Abstract = {Modern parallel architectures have both heterogeneous processors and deep, complex memory hierarchies. We present Legion, a programming model and runtime system for achieving high performance on these machines. Legion is organized around logical regions, which express both locality and independence of program data, and tasks, functions that perform computations on regions. We describe a runtime system that dynamically extracts parallelism from Legion programs, using a distributed, parallel scheduling algorithm that identifies both independent tasks and nested parallelism. Legion also enables explicit, programmer controlled movement of data through the memory hierarchy and placement of tasks based on locality information via a novel mapping interface. We evaluate our Legion implementation on three applications: fluid-flow on a regular grid, a three-level AMR code solving a heat diffusion equation, and a circuit simulation. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {The frenetic development of the current architectures places a strain on the current state-of-the-art programming environments. Harnessing the full potential of such architectures has been a tremendous task for the whole scientific computing community. We present DAGuE a generic framework for architecture aware scheduling and management of micro-tasks on distributed many-core heterogeneous architectures. Applications we consider can be represented as a Direct Acyclic Graph of tasks with labeled edges designating data dependencies. DAGs are represented in a compact, problem-size independent format that can be queried on-demand to discover data dependencies, in a totally distributed fashion. DAGuE assigns computation threads to the cores, overlaps communications and computations and uses a dynamic, fully-distributed scheduler based on cache awareness, data-locality and task priority. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, using several micro-benchmarks to analyze the performance of different components of the framework, and a Linear Algebra factorization as a use case.

	Abstract = {We present a method for developing dense linear algebra algorithms that seamlessly scales to thousands of cores. It can be done with our project called DPLASMA (Distributed PLASMA) that uses a novel generic distributed Direct Acyclic Graph Engine (DAGuE). The engine has been designed for high performance computing and thus it enables scaling of tile algorithms, originating in PLASMA, on large distributed memory systems. The underlying DAGuE framework has many appealing features when considering distributed-memory plat- forms with heterogeneous multicore nodes: DAG representation that is independent of the problem-size, automatic extraction of the communication from the dependencies, overlapping of communication and computation, task prioritization, and architecture-aware scheduling and management of tasks. The originality of this engine lies in its capacity to translate a sequential code with nested-loops into a concise and synthetic format which can then be interpreted and executed in a dis- tributed environment. We present three common dense linear algebra algorithms from PLASMA (Parallel Linear Algebra for Scalable Multi-core Architectures), namely: Cholesky, LU, and QR factorizations, to investigate their data driven expression and execution in a distributed system. We demonstrate through experimental results on the Cray XT5 Kraken system that our DAG-based approach has the potential to achieve sizable fraction of peak performance which is characteristic of the state-of-the-art distributed numerical software on current and emerging architectures.},

@article{Bueno:2012ka,
	Abstract = {Clusters of GPUs are emerging as a new computational scenario. Programming them requires the use of hybrid models that increase the complexity of the applications, reducing the productivity of programmers. We present the implementation of OmpSs for clusters of GPUs, which supports asynchrony and heterogeneity for task parallelism. It is based on annotating a serial application with directives that are translated by the compiler. With it, the same program that runs sequentially in a node with a single GPU can run in parallel in multiple GPUs either local (single node) or remote (cluster of GPUs). Besides performing a task-based parallelization, the runtime system moves the data as needed between the different nodes and GPUs minimizing the impact of communication by using affinity scheduling, caching, and by overlapping communication with the computational task. We show several applications programmed with OmpSs and their performance with multiple GPUs in a local node and in remote nodes. The results show good tradeoff between performance and effort from the programmer. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {This paper presents and characterizes Rodinia, a benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing. To help architects study emerging platforms such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), Rodinia includes applications and kernels which target multi-core CPU and GPU platforms. The choice of applications is inspired by Berkeley's dwarf taxonomy. Our characterization shows that the Rodinia benchmarks cover a wide range of parallel communication patterns, synchronization techniques and power consumption, and has led to some important architectural insight, such as the growing importance of memory-bandwidth limitations and the consequent importance of data layout.},

	Abstract = {The recently released Rodinia benchmark suite enables users to evaluate heterogeneous systems including both accelerators, such as GPUs, and multicore CPUs. As Rodinia sees higher levels of acceptance, it becomes important that researchers understand this new set of benchmarks, especially in how they differ from previous work. In this paper, we present recent extensions to Rodinia and conduct a detailed characterization of the Rodinia benchmarks (including performance results on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX480, the first product released based on the Fermi architecture). We also compare and contrast Rodinia with Parsec to gain insights into the similarities and differences of the two benchmark collections; we apply principal component analysis to analyze the application space coverage of the two suites. Our analysis shows that many of the workloads in Rodinia and Parsec are complementary, capturing different aspects of certain performance metrics.},

@article{Daga:2011ko,
	Abstract = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) has made significant strides as an accelerator in parallel computing. However, because the GPU has resided out on PCIe as a discrete device, the performance of GPU applications can be bottlenecked by data transfers between the CPU and GPU over PCIe. Emerging heterogeneous computing architectures that "fuse" the functionality of the CPU and GPU, e.g., AMD Fusion and Intel Knights Ferry, hold the promise of addressing the PCIe bottleneck. In this paper, we empirically characterize and analyze the efficacy of AMD Fusion, an architecture that combines general-purpose x86 cores and programmable accelerator cores on the same silicon die. We characterize its performance via a set of micro-benchmarks (e.g., PCIe data transfer), kernel benchmarks(e.g., reduction), and actual applications (e.g., molecular dynamics). Depending on the benchmark, our results show that Fusion produces a 1.7 to 6.0-fold improvement in the data-transfer time, when compared to a discrete GPU. In turn, this improvement in data-transfer performance can significantly enhance application performance. For example, running a reduction benchmark on AMD Fusion with its mere 80 GPU cores improves performance by 3.5-fold over the discrete AMD Radeon HD 5870 GPU with its 1600 more powerful GPU cores.},

	Abstract = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) continues to make in-roads as a computational accelerator for high-performance computing (HPC). However, despite its increasing popularity, mapping and optimizing GPU code remains a difficult task, it is a multi-dimensional problem that requires deep technical knowledge of GPU architecture. Although substantial literature exists on how to map and optimize GPU performance on the more mature NVIDIA CUDA architecture, the converse is true for OpenCL on an AMD GPU, such as the 1600-core AMD Radeon HD 5870 GPU. Consequently, we present and evaluate architecture-aware mapping and optimizations for the AMD GPU. The most prominent of which include (i) explicit use of registers, (ii) use of vector types, (iii) removal of branches, and (iv) use of image memory for global data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our AMD GPU mapping and optimizations by applying each in isolation as well as in concert to a large-scale, molecular modeling application called GEM. Via these AMD-specific GPU optimizations, our optimized OpenCL implementation on an AMD Radeon HD 5870 delivers more than a four-fold improvement in performance over the basic OpenCL implementation. In addition, it outperforms our optimized CUDA version on an NVIDIA GTX280 by 12\%. Overall, we achieve a speedup of 371-fold over a serial but hand-tuned SSE version of our molecular modeling application, and in turn, a 46-fold speedup over an ideal scaling on an 8-core CPU.

	Abstract = {Research efforts to analyze biomolecular properties contribute towards our understanding of biomolecular function. Calculating non-bonded forces (or in our case, electrostatic surface potential) is often a large portion of the computational complexity in analyzing biomolecular properties. Therefore, reducing the computational complexity of these force calculations, either by improving the computational algorithm or by improving the underlying hardware on which the computational algorithm runs, can help to accelerate the discovery process. Traditional approaches seek to parallelize the electrostatic calculations to run on large-scale supercomputers, which are expensive and highly contended resources. Leveraging our multi-scale approximation algorithm for calculating electrostatic surface potential, we present a novel mapping and optimization of this algorithm on the graphics processing unit (GPU) of a desktop personal computer (PC). Our mapping and optimization of the algorithm results in a speed-up as high as four orders of magnitude, when compared to running serially on the same desktop PC, without deteriorating the accuracy of our results.

	Abstract = {<div class="expandable">Breadth-first search (BFS) is an essentialgraph traversal strategy widely used in many computingapplications. Because of its irregular data access patterns,BFS has become a non-trivial problem hard to parallelizeefficiently. In this paper, we introduce a parallelizationstrategy that allows the load balancing of computationresources as well as the execution of graph traversals inhybrid environments composed of CPUs and GPUs. Toachieve that goal, we use a fine-grained task-based parallelizationscheme and the OmpSs programming model. Weobtain processing rates up to 2.8 billion traversed edgesper second with a single GPU and a multi-core processor.Our study shows high processing rates are achievablewith hybrid environments despite the GPU communicationlatency and memory coherence.</div>},

	Abstract = {An MPI library's implementation of broadcast communication can significantly affect the performance of applications built with that library. In order to choose between similar implementations or to evaluate available libraries, accurate measurements of broadcast performance are required. As we demonstrate, existing methods for measuring broadcast performance are either inaccurate or inadequate. Fortunately, we have designed an accurate method for measuring broadcast performance, even in a challenging grid environment. Measuring broadcast performance is not easy. Simply sending one broadcast after another allows them to proceed through the network concurrently, thus resulting in inaccurate per broadcast timings. Existing methods either fail to eliminate this pipelining effect or eliminate it by introducing overheads that are as difficult to measure as the performance of the broadcast itself. This problem becomes even more challenging in grid environments. Latencies along different links can vary significantly. Thus, an algorithm's performance is difficult to predict from it's communication pattern. Even when accurate prediction is possible, the pattern is often unknown. Our method introduces a measurable overhead to eliminate the pipelining effect, regardless of variations in link latencies View full abstract},

	Abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model from Google that facilitates parallel processing on a cluster of thousands of commodity computers. The success of MapReduce in cluster environments has motivated several studies of implementing MapReduce on a graphics processing unit (GPU), but generally focusing on the NVIDIA GPU. Our investigation reveals that the design and mapping of the MapReduce framework needs to be revisited for AMD GPUs due to their notable architectural differences from NVIDIA GPUs. For instance, current state-of-the-art MapReduce implementations employ atomic operations to coordinate the execution of different threads. However, atomic operations can implicitly cause inefficient memory access, and in turn, severely impact performance. In this paper, we propose Streamer, an OpenCL MapReduce framework optimized for AMD GPUs. With efficient atomic-free algorithms for output handling and intermediate result shuffling, Stream MR is superior to atomic-based MapReduce designs and can outperform existing atomic-free MapReduce implementations by nearly five-fold on an AMD Radeon HD 5870.

	Abstract = {Atomic operations are important building blocks in supporting general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPUs). For instance, they can be used to coordinate execution between concurrent threads, and in turn, assist in constructing complex data structures such as hash tables or implementing GPU-wide barrier synchronization. While the performance of atomic operations has improved substantially on the latest NVIDIA Fermi-based GPUs, system-provided atomic operations still incur significant performance penalties on AMD GPUs. A memory-bound kernel on an AMD GPU, for example, can suffer severe performance degradation when including an atomic operation, even if the atomic operation is never executed. In this paper, we first quantify the performance impact of atomic instructions to application kernels on AMD GPUs. We then propose a novel software-based implementation of atomic operations that can significantly improve the overall kernel performance. We evaluate its performance against the system-provided atomic using two micro-benchmarks and four real applications. The results show that using our software based atomic operations on an AMD GPU can speedup an application kernel by 67-fold over the same application kernel but with the (default) system-provided atomic operations.},

@article{Foster:2001th,
	Abstract = {"Grid" computing has emerged as an important new field, distinguished from conventional distributed computing by its focus on large-scale resource sharing, innovative applications, and, in some cases, high-performance orientation. In this article, we define this new field. First, we review the "Grid problem," which we define as flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources-what we refer to as virtual organizations. In such settings, we encounter unique authentication, authorization, resource access, resource discovery, and other challenges. It is this class of problem that is addressed by Grid technologies. Next, we present an extensible and open Grid architecture, in which protocols, services, application programming interfaces, and software development kits are categorized according to their roles in enabling resource sharing. We describe requirements that we believe any such mechanisms must satisfy, and we discuss the central role played by the intergrid protocols that enable interoperability among different Grid systems. Finally, we discuss how Grid technologies relate to other contemporary technologies, including enterprise integration, application service provider, storage service provider, and peer-to-peer computing. We maintain that Grid concepts and technologies complement and have much to contribute to these other approaches.},

	Abstract = {Chip Multi-Processors (CMPs) are evolving towards ever increasing core counts. Task-based programming models are a promising candidate for exploiting the parallelism offered by these machines. Simulation, the prevailing design methodology in computer architecture, is prohibitively time consuming, when it comes to CMPs featuring 1000s of cores. Sampled simulation is a standard technique for reducing simulation time for single-threaded architectures. Recently, these techniques have been extended to allow for simulation of multi-threaded systems. However, they have not been assessed for dynamically scheduled multi-threaded programs. In this work we use the OmpSs programming model [4]. OmpSs, an extension of OpenMP, allows to declare code blocks as tasks and to specify data consumed and produced by each task. The runtime environment executes tasks, potentially out of program order, on available cores, similar to the out-oforder execution in a superscalar processor. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Determining the best set of optimizations to apply to a kernel to be executed on the graphics processing unit (GPU) is a challenging problem. There are large sets of possible optimization configurations that can be applied, and many applications have multiple kernels. Each kernel may require a specific configuration to achieve the best performance, and moving an application to new hardware often requires a new optimization configuration for each kernel. In this work, we apply optimizations to GPU code using HMPP, a high-level directive-based language and source-to-source compiler that can generate CUDA / OpenCL code. However, programming with high-level languages may mean a loss of performance compared to using low-level languages. Our work shows that it is possible to improve the performance of a high-level language by using auto-tuning. We perform auto-tuning on a large optimization space on GPU kernels, focusing on loop permutation, loop unrolling, tiling, and specifying which loop(s) to parallelize, and show results on convolution kernels, codes in the PolyBench suite, and an implementation of belief propagation for stereo vision. The results show that our auto-tuned HMPP-generated implementations are significantly faster than the default HMPP implementation and can meet or exceed the performance of manually coded CUDA / OpenCL implementations.

	Abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPUs) are gaining widespread use in high-performance computing because of their performance advantages relative to CPUs. However, the reliability of GPUs is largely unproven. In particular, current GPUs lack error checking and correcting (ECC) in their memory subsystems. The impact of this design has not been previously measured at a large enough scale to quantify soft error events. We present MemtestG80, our software for assessing memory error rates on NVIDIA graphics cards. Furthermore, we present a large-scale assessment of GPU error rate, conducted by running MemtestG80 on over 50,000 hosts on the Folding@home distributed computing network. Our control experiments on consumer-grade and dedicated-GPGPU hardware in a controlled environment found no errors. However, our survey on Folding@home finds that, in their installed environments, two-thirds of tested GPUs exhibit a detectable, pattern-sensitive rate of memory soft errors. We show that these errors persist after controlling for over clocking and environmental proxies for temperature, but depend strongly on board architecture.},

	Abstract = {The innovative techniques of TCP Vegas have been the subject of much debate in recent years. Several studies have reported that TCP Vegas provides better performance than TCP Reno. However, the question of which of the new techniques are responsible for the impressive performance gains remains unanswered so far. This paper presents a detailed performance evaluation of TCP Vegas. By decomposing TCP Vegas into the various novel mechanisms proposed and assessing the effect of each of these mechanisms on performance, we show that the reported performance gains are achieved primarily by TCP Vegas's new techniques for slow start and congestion recovery. TCP Vegas's innovative congestion avoidance mechanism is shown to have only a minor influence on throughput. Furthermore, we find that the congestion avoidance mechanism exhibits fairness problems even if all competing connections operate with the same round trip time},

	Abstract = {To fully tap into the potential of today's heterogeneous machines, offloading parts of an application on accelerators is not sufficient. The real challenge is to build systems where the application would permanently spread across the entire machine, that is, where parallel tasks would be dynamically scheduled over the full set of available processing units. In this report we present SOCL, an OpenCL implementation that improves and simplifies the programming experience on heterogeneous architectures. SOCL enables applications to dynamically dispatch computation kernels over processing devices so as to maximize their utilization. OpenCL applications can incrementally make use of light extensions to automatically schedule kernels in a controlled manner on multi-device architectures. A preliminary automatic granularity adaptation extension is also provided. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach by experimenting with several OpenCL applications on a range of representative heterogeneous architectures. We show that performance portability is enhanced by using SOCL extensions.},

@techreport{Henzinger:2013wx,
	Abstract = {In order to guarantee that each method of a data structure updates the logical state exactly once, almost all non-blocking implementations employ Compare-And-Swap (CAS) based synchronization. For FIFO queue implementations this translates into concurrent enqueue or dequeue methods competing among themselves to update the same variable, the tail or the head, respectively, leading to high contention and poor scalability. Recent non-blocking queue implementations try to alleviate high contention by increasing the number of contention points, all the while using CAS-based synchronization. Furthermore, obtaining a wait-free implementation with competition is achieved by additional synchronization which leas to further degradation of performance.
In this paper we formalize the notion of competitiveness of a synchronizing statement which can be used as a measure for the scalability of concurrent implementations. We present a new queue implementation, the Speculative Pairing (SP) queue, which, as we show, decreases competitiveness by using Fetch-And-Increment (FAI) instead of CAS. We prove that the SP queue is linearizable and lock-free. We also show that replacing CAS with FAI leads to wait-freedom for dequeue methods without an adverse effect on performance. In fact, our experiments suggest that the SP queue can perform and scale better than the state-of-the-art queue implementations.},

@inproceedings{Ho:2012gv,
	Abstract = {Reliability is emerging as an important constraint for future microprocessors. Cooperative hardware and software approaches for error tolerance can solve this hardware reliability challenge. Cross-layer fault tolerance frameworks expose hardware failures to upper-layers, like the compiler, to help correct faults. Such cooperative approaches require less hardware complexity than masking all faults at the hardware level and are generally more energy efficient. This paper provides a detailed design and an implementation study of cross-layer fault tolerance for supercomputing. Since supercomputers necessarily involve large component counts, they have more frequent failures than consumer electronics and small systems. Conventionally, these systems use redundancy and check pointing to achieve reliable computing. However, redundancy increases acquisition as well as recurring energy costs. This paper describes a simple language-level mechanism coupled with complementary compilation and lightweight hardware error detection that provides efficient reliability and cross-layer fault-tolerance for supercomputers. Our evaluation focuses on strong scaling problems for which we can trade computing power for redundancy. Our results show a range of 1.07× to 2.5× speedup when employing cross-layer error-tolerance compared to conventional full dual modular redundancy (DMR) to contain all errors within hardware. Further, we demonstrate the approach can sustain 7\% to 50\% lower energy. The most important result of this work is qualitative: we can use a simplified hardware design with relaxed architectural correctness guarantees. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Apart form the success in local-area networks (LANs) and system-area networks and anticipated success in metropolitan and wide area networks (MANs and WANs), Ethernet continues to evolve to meet the increasing demands of packet-switched networks. Although the recently ratified 10-Gigabit Ethernet standard differs from earlier Ethernet standards, primarily in that 10GbE operates only over fiber and only in full-duplex mode, the differences are largely superficial. More importantly, l0GbE does not make obsolete current investments in network infrastructure. The 10GbE standard ensures interoperability not only with existing Ethernet but also with other networking technologies such as Sonet, thus paving the way for Ethernets expanded use in MANs and WANs. The world's first host-based 10GbE adapter, officially known as the Intel PRO/10GbE LR server adapter, introduces the benefits of l0GbE connectivity into LAN and system-area network environments, thereby accommodating the growing number of large-scale cluster systems and bandwidth-intensive applications, such as imaging and data mirroring. The 10GbE controller is optimized for servers that use the I/O bus backplanes of the peripheral component interface (PCI) and its higher speed extension, PCI-X.},

	Abstract = {The increasing numbers of cores, shared caches and memory nodes within machines introduces a complex hardware topology. High-performance computing applications now have to carefully adapt their placement and behavior according to the underlying hierarchy of hardware resources and their software affinities. We introduce the Hardware Locality (hwloc) software which gathers hardware information about processors, caches, memory nodes and more, and exposes it to applications and runtime systems in a abstracted and portable hierarchical manner. hwloc may significantly help performance by having runtime systems place their tasks or adapt their communication strategies depending on hardware affinities. We show that hwloc can already be used by popular high-performance OpenMP or MPI software. Indeed, scheduling OpenMP threads according to their affinities or placing MPI processes according to their communication patterns shows interesting performance improvement thanks to hwloc. An optimized MPI communication strategy may also be dynamically chosen according to the location of the communicating processes in the machine and its hardware characteristics. View full abstract},

@article{Jang:2011ct,
	Abstract = {The introduction of General-Purpose computation on GPUs (GPGPUs) has changed the landscape for the future of parallel computing. At the core of this phenomenon are massively multithreaded, data-parallel architectures possessing impressive acceleration ratings, offering low-cost supercomputing together with attractive power budgets. Even given the numerous benefits provided by GPGPUs, there remain a number of barriers that delay wider adoption of these architectures. One major issue is the heterogeneous and distributed nature of the memory subsystem commonly found on data-parallel architectures. Application acceleration is highly dependent on being able to utilize the memory subsystem effectively so that all execution units remain busy. In this paper, we present techniques for enhancing the memory efficiency of applications on data-parallel architectures, based on the analysis and characterization of memory access patterns in loop bodies; we target vectorization via data transformation to benefit vector-based architectures (e.g., AMD GPUs) and algorithmic memory selection for scalar-based architectures (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods with kernels from a wide range of benchmark suites. For the benchmark kernels studied, we achieve consistent and significant performance improvements (up to 11.4× and 13.5× over baseline GPU implementations on each platform, respectively) by applying our proposed methodology.},

	Abstract = {Map-reduce framework has received a significant attention and is being used for programming both large-scale clusters and multi-core systems. While the high productivity aspect of map-reduce has been well accepted, it is not clear if the API results in efficient implementations for different subclasses of data-intensive applications. In this paper, we present a system MATE (Map-reduce with an Alternate API), that provides a high-level, but distinct API. Particularly, our API includes a programmer-managed reduction object, which results in lower memory requirements at runtime for many data-intensive applications. MATE implements this API on top of the Phoenix system, a multi-core map-reduce implementation from Stanford. We evaluate our system using three data mining applications, and compare its performance to that of both Phoenix and Hadoop. Our results show that for all the three applications, MATE outperforms Phoenix and Hadoop. Despite achieving good scalability, MATE also maintains the easy-to-use API of map-reduce. Overall, we argue that, our approach, which is based on the generalized reduction structure, provides an alternate high-level API, leading to more efficient and scalable implementations.

	Abstract = {Nowadays Graphic Processing Units (GPU) are gaining increasing popularity in high performance computing (HPC). While modern GPUs can offer much more computational power than CPUs, they also consume much more power. Energy efficiency is one of the most important factors that will affect a broader adoption of GPUs in HPC. In this paper, we systematically characterize the power and energy efficiency of GPU computing. Specifically, using three different applications with various degrees of compute and memory intensiveness, we investigate the correlation between power consumption and different computational patterns under various voltage and frequency levels. Our study revealed that energy saving mechanisms on GPUs behave considerably different than CPUs. The characterization results also suggest possible ways to improve the 'greenness' of GPU computing.},

	Abstract = {Although MPI is a de-facto standard for parallel programming on distributed memory systems, writing MPI programs is often a time-consuming and complicated process. XcalableMP is a language extension of C and Fortran for parallel programming on distributed memory systems that helps users to reduce those programming efforts. XcalableMP provides two programming models. The first one is the global view model, which supports typical parallelization based on the data and task parallel paradigm, and enables parallelizing the original sequential code using minimal modification with simple, OpenMP-like directives. The other one is the local view model, which allows using CAF-like expressions to describe inter-node communication. Users can even use MPI and OpenMP explicitly in our language to optimize performance explicitly. In this paper, we introduce XcalableMP, the implementation of the compiler, and the performance evaluation result. For the performance evaluation, we parallelized HPCC Benchmark in XcalableMP. It shows that users can describe the parallelization for distributed memory system with a small modification to the original sequential code. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Heterogeneous computing on CPUs and GPUs has traditionally used fixed roles for each device: the GPU handles data parallel work by taking advantage of its massive number of cores while the CPU handles non data-parallel work, such as the sequential code or data transfer management. Unfortunately, this work distribution can be a poor solution as it under utilizes the CPU, has difficulty generalizing beyond the single CPU-GPU combination, and may waste a large fraction of time transferring data. Further, CPUs are performance competitive with GPUs on many workloads, thus simply partitioning work based on the fixed roles may be a poor choice. In this paper, we present the single kernel multiple devices (SKMD) system, a framework that transparently orchestrates collaborative execution of a single data-parallel kernel across multiple asymmetric CPUs and GPUs. The programmer is responsible for developing a single data-parallel kernel in OpenCL, while the system automatically partitions the workload across an arbitrary set of devices, generates kernels to execute the partial workloads, and efficiently merges the partial outputs together. The goal is performance improvement by maximally utilizing all available resources to execute the kernel. SKMD handles the difficult challenges of exposed data transfer costs and the performance variations GPUs have with respect to input size. On real hardware, SKMD achieves an average speedup of 29\% on a system with one multicore CPU and two asymmetric GPUs compared to a fastest device execution strategy for a set of popular OpenCL kernels.

	Abstract = {We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

@article{Lin:uh,
	Abstract = {With the explosive growth of genomic information, the searching of sequence databases has emerged as one of the most computation and data-intensive scientific applications. Our previous studies suggested that parallel genomic sequence-search possesses highly irregular computation and I/O patterns. Effectively addressing these runtime irregularities is thus the key to designing scalable sequence-search tools on massively parallel computers. While the computation scheduling for irregular scientific applications and the optimization of noncontiguous file accesses have been well-studied independently, little attention has been paid to the interplay between the two. In this paper, we systematically investigate the computation and I/O scheduling for data-intensive, irregular scientific applications within the context of genomic sequence search. Our study reveals that the lack of coordination between computation scheduling and I/O optimization could result in severe performance issues. We then propose an integrated scheduling approach that effectively improves sequence-search throughput by gracefully coordinating the dynamic load balancing of computation and high-performance noncontiguous I/O.

@article{Mamidala:2008bq,
	Abstract = {The advances in multicore technology and modern interconnects is rapidly accelerating the number of cores deployed in today's commodity clusters. A majority of parallel applications written in MPI employ collective operations in their communication kernels. Optimization of these operations on the multicore platforms is the key to obtaining good performance speed-ups. However, designing these operations on the modern multicores is a non-trivial task. Modern multicores such as Intel's Clovertown and AMD's Opteron feature various architectural attributes resulting in interesting ramifications. For example, Clovertown deploys shared 12 caches for a pair of cores whereas in Opteron, 12 caches are exclusive to a core. Understanding the impact of these architectures on communication performance is crucial to designing efficient collective algorithms. In this paper, we systematically evaluate these architectures and use these insights to develop efficient collective operations such as MPI_Bcast, MPI_Allgather, MPI_Allreduce and MPI_Alltoall. Further, we characterize the behavior of these collective algorithms on multicores especially when concurrent network and intra-node communications occur. We also evaluate the benefits of the proposed intra-node MPI_Allreduce over Opteron multicores and compare it with Intel Clovertown systems. The optimizations proposed in this paper reduce the latency of MPI-Bcast and MPI_Allgather by 1.9 and 4.0 times, respectively on 512 cores. For MPI_Allreduce, our optimizations improve the performance by as much as 33\% on the multicores. Further, we observe up to three times improvement in performance for matrix multiplication benchmark on 512 cores.},

@article{Manavski2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Searching for similarities in protein and DNA databases has become a routine procedure in Molecular Biology. The Smith-Waterman algorithm has been available for more than 25 years. It is based on a dynamic programming approach that explores all the possible alignments between two sequences; as a result it returns the optimal local alignment. Unfortunately, the computational cost is very high, requiring a number of operations proportional to the product of the length of two sequences. Furthermore, the exponential growth of protein and DNA databases makes the Smith-Waterman algorithm unrealistic for searching similarities in large sets of sequences. For these reasons heuristic approaches such as those implemented in FASTA and BLAST tend to be preferred, allowing faster execution times at the cost of reduced sensitivity. The main motivation of our work is to exploit the huge computational power of commonly available graphic cards, to develop high performance solutions for sequence alignment. RESULTS: In this paper we present what we believe is the fastest solution of the exact Smith-Waterman algorithm running on commodity hardware. It is implemented in the recently released CUDA programming environment by NVidia. CUDA allows direct access to the hardware primitives of the last-generation Graphics Processing Units (GPU) G80. Speeds of more than 3.5 GCUPS (Giga Cell Updates Per Second) are achieved on a workstation running two GeForce 8800 GTX. Exhaustive tests have been done to compare our implementation to SSEARCH and BLAST, running on a 3 GHz Intel Pentium IV processor. Our solution was also compared to a recently published GPU implementation and to a Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) solution. These tests show that our implementation performs from 2 to 30 times faster than any other previous attempt available on commodity hardware. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that graphic cards are now sufficiently advanced to be used as efficient hardware accelerators for sequence alignment. Their performance is better than any alternative available on commodity hardware platforms. The solution presented in this paper allows large scale alignments to be performed at low cost, using the exact Smith-Waterman algorithm instead of the largely adopted heuristic approaches.},

@article{Michael:2004ia,
	Abstract = {Lock-free objects offer significant performance and reliability advantages over conventional lock-based objects. However, the lack of an efficient portable lock-free method for the reclamation of the memory occupied by dynamic nodes removed from such objects is a major obstacle to their wide use in practice. We present hazard pointers, a memory management methodology that allows memory reclamation for arbitrary reuse. It is very efficient, as demonstrated by our experimental results. It is suitable for user-level applications - as well as system programs - without dependence on special kernel or scheduler support. It is wait-free. It requires only single-word reads and writes for memory access in its core operations. It allows reclaimed memory to be returned to the operating system. In addition, it offers a lock-free solution for the ABA problem using only practical single-word instructions. Our experimental results on a multiprocessor system show that the new methodology offers equal and, more often, significantly better performance than other memory management methods, in addition to its qualitative advantages regarding memory reclamation and independence of special hardware support. We also show that lock-free implementations of important object types, using hazard pointers, offer comparable performance to that of efficient lock-based implementations under no contention and no multiprogramming, and outperform them by significant margins under moderate multiprogramming and/or contention, in addition to guaranteeing continuous progress and availability, even in the presence of thread failures and arbitrary delays.},

Most previous research focuses on how to avoid the contended hot spots, Head and Tail, and there are two contradictory approaches: (1) lock-free techniques [1], [2], which increase the degree of parallelism to improve performance and (2) combining techniques [3], where a single combining thread performs a batch operation for the pending requests from other threads to reduce synchronization cost in a high degree of parallelism.

	Abstract = {This paper analyzes the interactions between the protocol stack (TCP/IP or iWARP over 10-Gigabit Ethernet) and its multicore environment. Specifically, for host-based protocols such as TCP/IP, we notice that a significant amount of processing is statically assigned to a single core, resulting in an imbalance of load on the different cores of the system and adversely impacting the performance of many applications. For host-offloaded protocols such as iWARP, on the other hand, the portions of the communication stack that are performed on the host, such as buffering of messages and memory copies, are closely tied with the associated process, and hence do not create such load imbalances. Thus, in this paper, we demonstrate that by intelligently mapping different processes of an application to specific cores, the imbalance created by the TCP/IP protocol stack can be largely countered and application performance significantly improved. At the same time, since the load is a better balanced in host-offloaded protocols such as iWARP, such mapping does not adversely affect their performance, thus keeping the mapping generic enough to be used with multiple protocol stacks.},

	Abstract = {The Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm is a local sequence alignment algorithm that attempts to align two biological sequences of varying length such that the alignment score is maximum. In this paper, we propose a new approach to reduce the time needed to perform the SW algorithm. This is done by applying the concept of recursive variable expansion, which exposes more parallelism in the algorithm than any other published method. The paper estimates the speed and hardware overhead for the newly proposed approach relative to other known acceleration methods. Using the new approach, it is possible to achieve a minimum speedup of 400 times better than the serial case for a typical sequence length of 500, which is 1.6 times higher than any other published method. The paper also shows that further speedup can be achieved using extra hardware to expose even more parallelism in the algorithm. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {This paper presents algorithms for improving the performance of parallel programs on multiprogrammed shared-memory NUMA multiprocessors, via the use of user-level dynamic page migration. The idea that drives the algorithms is that a page migration engine can perform accurate and timely page migrations in a multiprogrammed system if it can correlate page reference information with scheduling information obtained from the operating system. The necessary page migrations can be performed as a response to scheduling events that break the implicit association between threads and their memory affinity sets. We present two algorithms that use feedback from the kernel scheduler to aggressively migrate pages upon thread migrations. The first algorithm exploits the iterative nature of parallel programs, while the second targets generic codes without making assumptions on their structure. Performance evaluation on an SGI Origin2000 shows that our page migration algorithms provide substantial improvements in throughput of up to 264\% compared to the native IRIX 6.5.5 page placement and migration schemes View full abstract},

@article{Nomizu:2012ds,
	Abstract = {Due to their outstanding computational performance, many acceleration devices, such as GPUs, the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.), and multi-core computing are attracting a lot of attention in the field of high-performance computing. Although there are many programming models and languages de-signed for programming accelerators, such as CUDA, AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing (AMD APP), and OpenCL, these models remain difficult and complex. Furthermore, when programming for accelerator-enhanced clusters, we have to use an inter-node programming interface, such as MPI to coordinate the nodes. In order to address these problems and reduce complexity, an extension to XcalableMP (XMP), a PGAS language, for use on accelerator-enhanced clusters, called XcalableMP Device Acceleration Extension (XMP-dev), is proposed. In XMP-dev, a global distributed data is mapped onto distributed memory of each accelerator, and a fragment of codes can be of-floaded to execute in a set of accelerators. It eliminates the complex programming between nodes and accelerators and between nodes. In this paper, we present an implementation of the XMP-dev runtime library with the OpenCL APIs, while the previous implementation targets CUDA-only. Since OpenCL is a standardized interface supported for various kinds of accelerators, it improves the portability of XMP-dev and reduces the cost of development. In the result of performance evaluation, we show that the OpenCL implementation of XMP-dev can generate portable programs that can run on not only NVIDIA GPU-enhanced clusters but also various accelerator-enhanced clusters.

@article{Petrini:2001cn,
	Abstract = {The Quadrics interconnection network (QsNet) contributes two novel innovations to the field of high-performance interconnects: (I) integration of the virtual-address spaces of individual nodes into a single, global, virtual-address space and (2) network fault tolerance via link-level and end-to-end protocols that can detect faults and automatically re-transmit packets. QsNet achieves these feats by extending the native operating system in the nodes with a network operating system and specialized hardware support in the network interface. As these and other important features of QsNet can be found in the InfiniBand specification, QsNet can be viewed as a precursor to InfiniBand. In this paper, we present an initial performance evaluation of QsNet. We first describe the main hardware and software features of QsNet, followed by the results of benchmarks that we ran on our experimental, Intel-based, Linux cluster built around QsNet. Our initial analysis indicates that QsNet performs remarkably well, e.g., user-level latency under 2 $\mu$s and bandwidth over 300 MB/s},

@article{Pickering2015242,
	Abstract = {Abstract Directive-based programming of graphics processing units (GPUs) has recently appeared as a viable alternative to using specialized low-level languages such as \{CUDA\} C and OpenCL for general-purpose \{GPU\} programming. This technique, which uses {\^a}€{\oe}directive{\^a}€ or {\^a}€{\oe}pragma{\^a}€ statements to annotate source codes written in traditional high-level languages, is designed to permit a unified code base to serve multiple computational platforms. In this work we analyze the popular OpenACC programming standard, as implemented by the \{PGI\} compiler suite, in order to evaluate its utility and performance potential in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. We examine the process of applying the OpenACC Fortran \{API\} to a test \{CFD\} code that serves as a proxy for a full-scale research code developed at Virginia Tech; this test code is used to asses the performance improvements attainable for our \{CFD\} algorithm on common \{GPU\} platforms, as well as to determine the modifications that must be made to the original source code in order to run efficiently on the GPU. Performance is measured on several recent \{GPU\} architectures from \{NVIDIA\} and \{AMD\} (using both double and single precision arithmetic) and the accelerator code is benchmarked against a multithreaded \{CPU\} version constructed from the same Fortran source code using OpenMP directives. A single \{NVIDIA\} Kepler \{GPU\} card is found to perform approximately 20{\~A}--- faster than a single \{CPU\} core and more than 2{\~A}--- faster than a 16-core Xeon server. An analysis of optimization techniques for OpenACC reveals cases in which manual intervention by the programmer can improve accelerator performance by up to 30% over the default compiler heuristics, although these optimizations are relevant only for specific platforms. Additionally, the use of multiple accelerators with OpenACC is investigated, including an experimental high-level interface for multi-GPU programming that automates scheduling tasks across multiple devices. While the overall performance of the OpenACC code is found to be satisfactory, we also observe some significant limitations and restrictions imposed by the OpenACC \{API\} regarding certain useful features of modern Fortran (2003/8); these are sufficient for us to conclude that it would not be practical to apply OpenACC to our full research code at this time due to the amount of refactoring required. },

@inproceedings{Rafique:2011it,
	Abstract = {Coprocessors such as GPUs are increasingly being deployed in clusters to process scientific and compute-intensive jobs. In this work, we study if GPU-based heterogeneous clusters can benefit client-server applications. Specifically, we consider the practical situation where multiple client-server applications share a heterogeneous cluster (multi-tenancy), and experience unpredictable variations in incoming client request rates, including steep load spikes. Even for "compute-intensive" client-server applications, it is unclear if a GPU-based cluster can seamlessly deliver acceptable response times in the presence of multi-tenancy and load spikes. We argue that a cluster-level scheduler that is aware of application load, request deadlines and the heterogeneity is necessary in this situation. We propose a novel scheduler called Symphony that enables efficient, dynamic sharing of a GPU-based heterogeneous cluster across multiple concurrently-executing client-server applications, each with arbitrary load spikes. Symphony performs three key tasks: it (i) monitors the load on each application, (ii) collects past performance data and dynamically builds simple performance models of available processing resources and (iii) computes a priority for pending requests based on the above parameters and the requests' slack. Based on this, it reorders client requests across different applications to achieve acceptable response times. We also define how client-server applications should interact with a scheduler such as Symphony, and develop an API to this end. We deploy Symphony as user-space middleware on a high-end heterogeneous cluster with dual quad-core Xeon CPUs and dual NVIDIA Fermi GPUs. An evaluation using representative applications shows that in the presence of load spikes (i) Symphony incurs 2-20x fewer requests that do not meet response time constraints compared with other schedulers, and (ii) in order to achieve the same performance as Symphony, other schedulers need 2- - x more cluster nodes.},

	Abstract = {A trend that has materialized, and has given rise to much attention, is of the increasingly heterogeneous computing platforms. Recently, it has become very common for a desktop or a notebook computer to be equipped with both a multi-core CPU and a GPU. Application development for exploiting the aggregate computing power of such an environment is a major challenge today. Particularly, we need dynamic work distribution schemes that are adaptable to different computation and communication patterns in applications, and to various heterogeneous configurations. This paper describes a general dynamic scheduling framework for mapping applications with different communication patterns to heterogeneous architectures. We first make key observations about the architectural tradeoffs among heterogeneous resources and the communication pattern of an application, and then infer constraints for the dynamic scheduler. We then present a novel cost model for choosing the optimal chunk size in a heterogeneous configuration. Finally, based on general framework and cost model we provide optimized work distribution schemes to further improve the performance. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Heterogeneous architectures comprising a multicore CPU and many-core GPU(s) are increasingly being used within cluster and cloud environments. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing the overall throughput of a set of applications deployed on a cluster of such heterogeneous nodes. We consider two different scheduling formulations. In the first formulation, we consider jobs that can be executed on either the GPU or the CPU of a single node. In the second formulation, we consider jobs that can be executed on the CPU, GPU, or both, of any number of nodes in the system. We have developed scheduling schemes addressing both of the problems. In our evaluation, we first show that the schemes proposed for first formulation outperform a blind round-robin scheduler and approximate the performances of an ideal scheduler that involves an impractical exhaustive exploration of all possible schedules. Next, we show that the scheme proposed for the second formulation outperforms the best of existing schemes for heterogeneous clusters, TORQUE and MCT, by up to 42\%.},

@article{Ruscio2006,
	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of the nucleosome core particle and its isolated DNA free in solution are reported. The simulations are based on the implicit solvent methodology and provide insights into the nature of large-scale structural fluctuations and flexibility of the nucleosomal DNA. In addition to the kinked regions previously identified in the x-ray structure of the nucleosome, the simulations support the existence of a biochemically identified distorted region of the DNA. Comparison of computed relative free energies shows that formation of the kinks is associated with little, if any, energy cost relative to a smooth, ideal conformation of the DNA superhelix. Isolated nucleosomal DNA is found to be considerably more flexible than expected for a 147 bp stretch of DNA based on its canonical persistence length of 500 A. Notably, the significant bending of the DNA observed in our simulations occurs without breaking of Watson-Crick bonds. The computed relative stability of bent conformations is sensitive to the ionic strength of the solution in the physiological range; the sensitivity suggests possible experiments that might provide further insights into the structural origins of the unusual flexibility of the DNA.},

@article{Satish:2012hh,
	Abstract = {Current processor trends of integrating more cores with wider SIMD units, along with a deeper and complex memory hierarchy, have made it increasingly more challenging to extract performance from applications. It is believed by some that traditional approaches to programming do not apply to these modern processors and hence radical new languages must be discovered. In this paper, we question this thinking and offer evidence in support of traditional programming methods and the performance-vs-programming effort effectiveness of common multi-core processors and upcoming manycore architectures in delivering significant speedup, and close-to-optimal performance for commonly used parallel computing workloads. We first quantify the extent of the ``Ninja gap'', which is the performance gap between naively written C/C++ code that is parallelism unaware (often serial) and best-optimized code on modern multi-/many-core processors. Using a set of representative throughput computing benchmarks, we show that there is an average Ninja gap of 24X (up to 53X) for a recent 6-core Intel{\textregistered} Core{\texttrademark} i7 X980 Westmere CPU, and that this gap if left unaddressed will inevitably increase. We show how a set of well-known algorithmic changes coupled with advancements in modern compiler technology can bring down the Ninja gap to an average of just 1.3X. These changes typically require low programming effort, as compared to the very high effort in producing Ninja code. We also discuss hardware support for programmability that can reduce the impact of these changes and even further increase programmer productivity. We show equally encouraging results for the upcoming Intel{\textregistered} Many Integrated Core architecture (Intel{\textregistered} MIC) which has more cores and wider SIMD. We thus demonstrate that we can contain the otherwise uncontrolled growth of the Ninja gap and offer a more stable and predictable performance growth over future archit- ctures, offering strong evidence that radical language changes are not required.

	Abstract = {Many nonblocking algorithms have been proposed for shared queues. Previous studies indicate that link-based algorithms perform best. However, these algorithms have a memory management problem: a dequeued node cannot be freed or reused without proper handling. The problem is usually overlooked; one just assumes the existence of a lower level mechanism, which takes care of all the details of a lower level mechanism, which takes care of all the details of handling the problem. Employing such a mechanism incurs significant overheads, and consequently the link-based queues may not perform as well as claimed. A new non-blocking queue algorithm based on a finite array is proposed. Compared with the link-based algorithms, the new algorithm provides the same degree of concurrency without being subject to the memory problem, hence suggests a good performance View full abstract},

@article{Stratton:2012hw,
	Abstract = {It is unquestionable that successive hardware generations have significantly improved GPU computing workload performance over the last several years. Moore's law and DRAM scaling have respectively increased single-chip peak instruction throughput by 3X and off-chip bandwidth by 2.2X from NVIDIA's GeForce 8800 GTX in November 2006 to its GeForce GTX 580 in November 2010. However, raw capability numbers typically underestimate the improvements in real application performance over the same time period, due to significant architectural feature improvements. To demonstrate the effects of architecture features and optimizations over time, we conducted experiments on a set of benchmarks from diverse application domains for multiple GPU architecture generations to understand how much performance has truly been improving for those workloads. First, we demonstrate that certain architectural features make a huge difference in the performance of unoptimized code, such as the inclusion of a general cache which can improve performance by 2-4× in some situations. Second, we describe what optimization patterns have been most essential and widely applicable for improving performance for GPU computing workloads across all architecture generations. Some important optimization patterns included data layout transformation, converting scatter accesses to gather accesses, GPU workload regularization, and granularity coarsening, each of which improved performance on some benchmark by over 20\%, sometimes by a factor of more than 5×. While hardware improvements to baseline unoptimized code can reduce the speedup magnitude, these patterns remain important for even the most recent GPUs. Finally, we identify which added architectural features created significant new optimization opportunities, such as increased register file capacity or reduced bandwidth penalties for misaligned accesses, which increase performance by 2× or more in the optimized versions of relevant b- nchmarks.

@article{Stuart:2011uh,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the design of synchronization primitives---specifically barriers, mutexes, and semaphores---and how they apply to the GPU. Previous implementations are insufficient due to the discrepancies in hardware and programming model of the GPU and CPU. We create new implementations in CUDA and analyze the performance of spinning on the GPU, as well as a method of sleeping on the GPU, by running a set of memory-system benchmarks on two of the most common GPUs in use, the Tesla- and Fermi-class GPUs from NVIDIA. From our results we define higher-level principles that are valid for generic many-core processors, the most important of which is to limit the number of atomic accesses required for a synchronization operation because atomic accesses are slower than regular memory accesses. We use the results of the benchmarks to critique existing synchronization algorithms and guide our new implementations, and then define an abstraction of GPUs to classify any GPU based on the behavior of the memory system. We use this abstraction to create suitable implementations of the primitives specifically targeting the GPU, and analyze the performance of these algorithms on Tesla and Fermi. We then predict performance on future GPUs based on characteristics of the abstraction. We also examine the roles of spin waiting and sleep waiting in each primitive and how their performance varies based on the machine abstraction, then give a set of guidelines for when each strategy is useful based on the characteristics of the GPU and expected contention.},

	Abstract = {Optimizing programs for Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) requires thorough knowledge about the values of architectural features for the new computing platform. However, this knowledge is frequently unavailable, e.g., due to insufficient documentation, which is probably a result of the infancy of general purpose computing on the GPU. What makes the modeling of program performance on GPU even more difficult is that the exact value of some ``architectural'' parameters on the GPU depends on how a GPU program interacts with those features. For example, AMD GPUs show different memory latencies when the memory is accessed with address sequences that have different patterns. Current micro-benchmark suites such as X-Ray are powerless for characterizing the GPU. Clearly, a preliminary for efficient code optimization and automatic tuning on the GPU is a systematic method to measure the architectural features and identify the most basic program characteristics that determine the performance of a program on the new GPU architectures. In this paper, we present a micro-benchmark suite for AMD GPUs that supports the AMD StreamSDK. Our model identifies and measures a series of architectural features and basic program characteristics that are most important and most predictive for program performance on the platform. The features and characteristics include vectorization, burst write latency, texture fetch latency, global read and write latency, ALU/Fetch operation ratio, domain size and register usage for both AMD's pixel shader and compute shader modes. Our performance model not only generates correct values for those parameters, but also provides a clear picture of program performance on the GPU. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Multicore processors and a variety of accelerators have allowed scientific applications to scale to larger problem sizes. We present a performance, design methodology, platform, and architectural comparison of several application accelerators executing a Quantum Monte Carlo application. We compare the application's performance and programmability on a variety of platforms including CUDA with Nvidia GPUs, Brook+ with ATI graphics accelerators, OpenCL running on both multicore and graphics processors, C++ running on multicore processors, and a VHDL implementation running on a Xilinx FPGA. We show that OpenCL provides application portability between multicore processors and GPUs, but may incur a performance cost. Furthermore, we illustrate that graphics accelerators can make simulations involving large numbers of particles feasible.},

	Abstract = {Using GPUs as computational accelerators has been a growing area of research in the past several years. One particular area amenable to exploiting video card hardware is dense linear algebra. We continue this trend by generalizing the MAGMA xGEMM kernels, porting them to OpenCL and tuning them to run on the AMD 7970. Achieving up to 1.7 TFlops in SGEMM and 650 GFlops in DGEMM, we extend this performance to multiple GPUs using a parallel-for algorithm designed to run on multiple heterogeneous devices. Using 3 Radeon 7970s, our large GEMM algorithm obtains 4.37TFlops in single precision and 1.64 TFlops/s in double. View full abstract},

	Abstract = {Rather than painful, manual, static, per-connection optimization of TCP buffer sizes simply to achieve acceptable performance for distributed applications, many researchers have proposed techniques to perform this tuning automatically. This paper first discusses the relative merits of the various approaches in theory, and then provides substantial experimental data concerning two competing implementations-the buffer autotuning already present in Linux 2.4.x and "dynamic right-sizing." The paper reveals heretofore unknown aspects of the problem and current solutions, provides insight into the proper approach for different circumstances, and points toward ways to further improve performance.},

@article{Zong:2011go,
	Abstract = {High-performance clusters have been widely deployed to solve challenging and rigorous scientific and engineering tasks. On one hand, high performance is certainly an important consideration in designing clusters to run parallel applications. On the other hand, the ever increasing energy cost requires us to effectively conserve energy in clusters. To achieve the goal of optimizing both performance and energy efficiency in clusters, in this paper, we propose two energy-efficient duplication-based scheduling algorithms-Energy-Aware Duplication (EAD) scheduling and Performance-Energy Balanced Duplication (PEBD) scheduling. Existing duplication-based scheduling algorithms replicate all possible tasks to shorten schedule length without reducing energy consumption caused by duplication. Our algorithms, in contrast, strive to balance schedule lengths and energy savings by judiciously replicating predecessors of a task if the duplication can aid in performance without degrading energy efficiency. To illustrate the effectiveness of EAD and PEBD, we compare them with a nonduplication algorithm, a traditional duplication-based algorithm, and the dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) algorithm. Extensive experimental results using both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively save energy with marginal performance degradation.
