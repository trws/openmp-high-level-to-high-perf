\subsection{Further Evolution of Tasking Support}
\label{sub:new_tasking}

OpenMP 5.0 continues the evolution of the OpenMP tasking model toward 
addressing more use cases.  Task reductions, task affinity, and 
additional forms of task dependences provide enhanced performance and 
ease of use.  Prior to OpenMP 5.0, lack of support for explicit task 
reductions required users to implement their own reductions by 
collecting and later combining per-thread partial values, passing 
partial values through the tree of tasks, or using locks or atomics 
with resulting serialization of those operations.  The 
\texttt{task\_reduction} clause allows a reduction over a task group, 
and the \texttt{reduction} clause is extended to include reduction 
over taskloops.  The \texttt{in\_reduction} clause appears on tasks that 
participate in the reduction, which can include target tasks that 
offload computation or transfer data to devices.

Support for task dependences is extended in two new ways.  First, use 
of iterators is allowed in the \texttt{depend} clause, as described 
previously in Section~\ref{sub:iterators}. Second, a new dependence type 
allows a set of tasks to commute with respect to one another with the 
constraints that their executions are mutually exclusive and that 
they satisfy any dependences with respect to tasks outside the set.

Like task dependences, task affinity indicates the data used by a task. 
However, task affinity is a hint to the runtime that guides the scheduling 
of tasks to threads, rather than enforcing an ordering among the threads. 
The runtime may schedule tasks that use the same data to the same thread 
or threads that execute on cores in the same NUMA  domain. An advanced 
runtime may also use the information to tune work stealing for better 
locality. Future versions of OpenMP may the \texttt{affinity} clause to
other constructs besides the \texttt{task} construct.
