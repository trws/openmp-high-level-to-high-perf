\subsection{Memory Allocation Extensions}

While OpenMP 5.0 will introduce the major building blocks for memory 
allocation support (memory spaces, allocators and APIs) we will extend 
this support. One such direction will be to allow users to determine
the memory resources of a particular system and to create memory spaces with 
a more precise description and not just to rely on pre-defined ones. The 
number of allocator traits will increase to allow users to specify a larger 
range of behaviors. For example, we envision traits that support: memory
pinning; distribution of allocations across NUMA domains; fixed-object 
allocations (i.e., where all allocation invocations have the same size);
and allocators with stack semantics. We will also eventually improve
support of allocation of variables specified in \texttt{map} clauses, as
well as C++ variables generally.
