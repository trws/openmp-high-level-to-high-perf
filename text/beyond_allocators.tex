\subsection{Memory Allocation Extensions}

While OpenMP 5.0 will introduce the major building blocks for memory allocation support (memory spaces, allocators and APIs) we anticipate further work to complete this support. 

One such direction will be to allow programmers to query about the memory resources of a particular system and to be able to create memory spaces with a more precise description from the user and not just rely on the pre-defined ones.

We expect the number of allocator traits to increase to allow users to specify a larger range of behaviors. For example, we envision traits that would allow to pin memory, to distribute allocations across NUMA domains, to specify fixed-object allocations (i.e., where all allocation invocations have the same size) or allocators with stack semantics.

Supporting allocation of variables specified in \texttt{map} clauses and better support of the C++ language also will be tackled in the future.
