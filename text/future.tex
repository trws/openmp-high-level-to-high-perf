\section{Longer Term Directions}
\label{sec:future_directions}

While OpenMP 5.0 is clearly a major step in the evolution of OpenMP,
we already know that we will not address every issue that remains.
We plan to release a minor revision of 5.0 in November 2020 (nominally,
it will be OpenMP 5.1) which we again do not expect to address every
open issue. We have established a cadence of major releases of the
OpenMP specification, which we plan to continue. In this section, we 
anticipate the long term evolution of OpenMP; we may realize some these 
directions in OpenMP 5.1 but we will defer many of them to OpenMP 6.0 
or later.
