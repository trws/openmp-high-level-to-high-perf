One of the major developments of version 4.0 of the OpenMP specification was to enable OpenMP to exploit all parallelism available in modern supercomputers. On the one hand OpenMP was extended to support accelerators. On the other hand, it was extended to support SIMD vector parallelism available in modern processors.
