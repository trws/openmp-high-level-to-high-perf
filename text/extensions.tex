\section{Recent OpenMP Extensions}
\label{sec:recent_extensions}

OpenMP 4.0 extends the API to cover two additional major forms of
parallelism: accelerator offload and SIMD vectorization. Almost all
current systems include hardware that require these parallel programming 
patterns. This section discusses the related extensions as well as several 
tasking extensions in OpenMP 4.0 and 4.5.
