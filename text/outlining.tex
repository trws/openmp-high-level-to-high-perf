\subsection{Enabling Language-Level Outlining}
\label{sub:enabling_language_level_outlining}

As Section~\ref{sub:outlining} discussed, outlining, or extraction of code 
into functions by the compiler, is a core mechanism used to implement OpenMP. 
Some base languages provide outlining mechanisms in the form of closures or 
lambdas. The writers of libraries and parallel frameworks find these 
constructs attractive since they can describe abstract patterns and behaviors 
that then are passed an arbitrarily complex code sequence and associated data.
Frameworks like Kokkos~\cite{kokkos} and RAJA~\cite{raja} exploit this 
mechanism to create flexible looping constructs, like the one in 
Figure~\ref{fig:raja}, that can be compiled for host devices, targets or 
other parallel backends depending on compile time arguments. These 
mechanisms pose challenges that OpenMP 5.0 will begin to address.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}{c}
RAJA::forall<omp_parallel_for>(
    RAJA::range(0, n),
    [=](int a) {
      // loop body
});
\end{minted}

While OpenMP must evolve to support mechanisms such as lambdas, Fortran
users of OpenMP currently cannot exploit the capabilities that we will 
provide. Although many OpenMP implementations use outlining, they do not 
expose the resulting functions to the user. However, exposing them could 
provide many benefits, including a mechanism to support closures in Fortran.
 
We could extend the \texttt{task} directive to create a form 
of "callable task" or OpenMP closure object that would be portable across 
C, C++ and Fortran. The extension would significantly reduce the work 
required to make an arbitrary callable object with state in C and Fortran.
It would also support library implementations with functionality like that 
of Kokkos and RAJA that all three languages could use. Challenges remain,
however, such as to integrate the functionality with existing OpenMP 
constructs and how to make it as efficient as possible at runtime. A simple 
and portable solution generates a structure, or derived type, and a function 
pointer. This solution easily integrates with established libraries, but will
likely perform poorly for frequently called functions. Despite the challenges,
giving users control of outlining could be a major step forward for OpenMP.
