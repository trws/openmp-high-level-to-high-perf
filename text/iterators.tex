\subsection{Iterators}
\label{sub:iterators}

Many OpenMP clauses accept lists of parameters. In OpenMP 4.5 or earlier, 
while many OpenMP clauses accept expressions, the expressions (but not 
their values) must be fully determined at compile time. Thus, the number 
of elements in each list is static and, for example, the \texttt{depend} 
clause can specify a dependence on multiple elements of an array but the 
number of elements (or array sections) must be known at compile time. This 
requirement can prevent the expression of some algorithms or make their 
expression more complex. For example, if a corner cell has fewer dependences 
than an inner cell then the user may need to modify the base language code 
to provide separate annotations for each case. Further, the limitation can 
require the use of long error-prone lists even when the number of list 
elements is static. This limitation arises from the lack of general 
programming constructs in OpenMP directives, which we plan to reduce as 
discussed in Section~\ref{sub:relationship_to_base_languages}, 

To overcome this lack of expressiveness, OpenMP will add the concept of
iterators. This mechanism can iterate through a range of values to produce 
list-items at runtime. Thus, a clause can have a dynamic number of list 
elements. Figure~\ref{fig:iterators} shows how this feature supports a
\texttt{task} construct with a variable number of dependences.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}{c}
void func(double * a, size_t n) {
#pragma omp task depend(inout:a[i]:i=0:n)
   work(a);
}
\end{minted}
