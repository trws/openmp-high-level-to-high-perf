%% BRONIS: Small tweak to kill orphan
Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been
optimized for performance only on Intel microprocessors.  Performance
tests, such as SYSmark and MobileMark, are measured using specific
computer systems, components, software, operations and functions.  Any
change to those factors may cause the results to vary.  You
should consult other information and performance tests to assist you
in fully evaluating your contemplated purchases, including the
performance of that product when combined with other products.  For

Intel's compilers may or may not optimize to the same degree for
non-Intel microprocessors for optimizations that are not unique to
Intel microprocessors. These optimizations include SSE2, SSE3, and
SSSE3 instruction sets and other optimizations. Intel does not
guarantee the availability, functionality, or effectiveness of any
optimization on microprocessors not manufactured by
Intel. Microprocessor-dependent optimizations

specific to Intel microarchitecture are reserved for Intel
microprocessors. Please refer to the applicable product User and
Reference Guides for more information on the specific
instruction sets covered by this notice.
