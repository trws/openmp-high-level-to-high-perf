\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The OpenMP effort began in 1996 when a handful of vendors (DEC, HP, IBM, 
Intel, Kuck and Associates, and SGI) were brought together by the Accelerated 
Strategic Computing Initiative~(ASCI) of the Department of Energy (DOE) to 
create a portable application programming interface~(API) for shared memory 
computers. Vendors do not typically work well together unless an outside 
force compels cooperation. In this case, that compulsion came from Mary 
Zosel and the ASCI parallel tools team who communicated that ASCI would 
only purchase systems from vendors who supported a portable API for shared 
memory programming. DOE researchers played a key role in defining OpenMP 
from the beginning, helping to ensure that the API met the needs of HPC 
applications programmers.

Early public presentations about the project~\cite{ewomp99} clearly
defined the initial group's goals:

\begin{itemize}
  \item To support portable, efficient and comprehensible shared-memory 
        parallel programs;
  \item To produce specifications based on common practice that 
        could be readily implemented;
  \item To provide a consistent Fortran, C and C++ APIs to the 
        most reasonable extent possible;
  \item To be lean and mean, i.e., to  be only as large as required 
        to express important control-parallel, shared-memory programs  
        but no larger;
  \item To support backwards compatibility as it evolved;
  \item To support \emph{serial equivalence}, i.e., for correct OpenMP 
        programs to produce the same result whether run serially or in
        parallel, to the greatest possible extent.
\end{itemize}

The first OpenMP specification  was released in November 1997 at SC97. The
OpenMP community in the late 90s was painfully aware of other parallel
programming  standardization efforts, such as HPF and MPI 2.0, that
suffered from multi-year delays as implementors struggled to produce robust,
application-ready implementations. Thus, OpenMP by design was narrowly
focused on current practice. This focus led to the availability of multiple
vendor-supported implementations within a year of the release of that 
first specification, 

Over time, additional vendors and research organizations joined the effort.  A
non-profit corporation, the OpenMP Architecture Review Board (ARB), was 
incorporated to prevent any single vendor from dominating the standard.
The current 30 members of the OpenMP ARB continue to own and to evolve 
the API to serve the needs of parallel application programmers. The ARB
retains many of the original goals of the initial group in its mission,
which is to standardize directive-based multi-language high-level 
parallelism that is performant, productive and portable. The OpenMP 
API now ptovides a portable, scalable model that gives parallel 
programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel 
applications for platforms ranging from embedded systems and accelerator 
devices to multicore systems and shared-memory systems.
