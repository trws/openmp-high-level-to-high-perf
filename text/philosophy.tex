\section{Philosophy}

\tom{This is a first crack, but covers a point that isn't explicitly brought out
  in the introduction that is necessary to motivate the use of outlining for
  example}

The general philosophy of OpenMP is to provide a portable, expressive
programming model for parallel and concurrent programming that allows a user to
keep their code as close to the original serial version as possible while still
achieving performance goals.

\subsection{Serial Equivalence}
\label{sub:serial_equivalence}

A common misconception about OpenMP is that all OpenMP programs, or at least all
correct OpenMP programs, provide serial equivalence. In this case serial
equivalence refers to a guarantee that if a program is compiled with all OpenMP
constructs completely ignored it will get the same answer as both the original
serial code and the OpenMP code in parallel.  The truth is significantly more
complicated.  All OpenMP constructs make it possible to write a program with
serial equivalence, but it is equally possible to write correct, well-formed
programs that get different answers not only between sequential and parallel but
also for any given number of threads.

The reason for this is that OpenMP provides information to the user about how
their code is being run and attempts to offer high performance by default, and
serial equivalence if needed.  It is possible to write code that depends on the
number of threads by using runtime routines to query the thread count and the
identity of a given thread.  Given code that avoids doing anything based on the
number of threads, there are still two factors that can create programs without
serial equivalence: data privatization and execution order.  For example, a
workshared loop with a reduction clause makes no guarantee of the order in which
the intermediate products are combined.  This makes it both non-deterministic
and non-serial-equivalent for any reduction over floating point numbers.

Serial equivalence will continue to be possible in OpenMP for the foreseeable
future, but as the specification grows and more control is given to the user,
the number of ways to write code without serial equivalence also grows.
