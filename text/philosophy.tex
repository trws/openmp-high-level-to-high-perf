\section{The Guiding Philosophy of OpenMP}
\label{sec:philosophy}

The general philosophy of OpenMP reflects the ARB's mission to standardize 
directive-based multi-language high-level parallelism that is performant, 
productive and portable. Portability is achieved first and foremost through
broad adoption and support of the specification. At the highest level, a 
directive-based approach supports productivity through incremental 
parallelization and refinement through which user code remains as close 
to its original serial version as possible while still achieving performance 
goals. Directives allow the programmer to specify information that a compiler
would otherwise not be able to determine -- or that might require complex
and error-prone analysis. Further, OpenMP provides sensible defaults that 
often result in high performance but also allows low-level control of 
aspects that the compiler and runtime may not deduce high quality settings.

As we discussed in the introduction, OpenMP retains many of its original
goals, which embodied a general philosophy. However, like the specification, 
the philosophy of OpenMP has evolved as it has expanded to support a wider
range of parallel programming patterns. The remainder of this section 
discusses the evolution of two key aspects of the original philosophy,
language independence and serial equivalence, as well as the issue of
descriptiveness versus prescriptiveness, a philosophical issue for 
programming models that has recently received significant attention.
