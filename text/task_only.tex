\subsection{Free-Agent Threads}
\label{sub:task_only_threads}

%% BRONIS: This section would discuss the unshackled threads idea
%% BRONIS: I think I want to call them ``free-agent threads''

Currently, only threads of the parallel region in which an explicit
OpenMP task is generated can execute that task. This limitation leads
to the unintuitive requirement that pure tasking programs in OpenMP
must first start a \texttt{parallel} region and then must ensure that 
only one thread executes the code that generates the tasks, for example, 
by using a \texttt{single} region. While unintuitive, the requirement is
simple. However, it also can unnecessarily limit parallelism in more
complex applications since other threads (resources) may be idle and 
available to execute the tasks.

We are exploring a concept of free-agent threads to overcome this 
limitation. The mechanism would allow any thread that is not assigned
to a team to execute any explicit task. It would fully eliminate the
limitation -- all threads could execute explicit tasks that are 
generated in the initial thread without requiring an explicit 
\texttt{parallel} region. This mechanism will require us to define 
the return values for runtime routines such as \texttt{omp\_get\_thread\_num}
when executed by a thread that is not part of the team. We must resolve
many other details. Since this change will represent a major change in 
the OpenMP execution model, we do not expect to adopt it before OpenMP 6.0.
