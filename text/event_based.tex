\subsection{Event-Based Parallel Programming Pattern}
\label{sub:concurrency_and_event_based_model}

One parallel programming pattern that OpenMP does not yet support is the
event-driven model that many interactive applications and networking servers
use. In this model, one or more threads run continuously in an event loop to 
observe external (e.g., user) actions. Other threads then perform the 
computation that the actions trigger to minimize response times. This 
event-based pattern naturally suits a task-based model. 
 
OpenMP's current task model does not suit the event-based pattern since it 
requires the team of the thread that generates a task to execute that task. 
To support this pattern, OpenMP needs a new capability to allow a thread to 
direct work toward a team other than its own. This capability would allow 
the event thread to remain responsive as other teams concurrently handle 
event processing. In addition, a mechanism that creates re-usable tasks 
could further improve response times.
