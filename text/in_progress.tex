\section{The Next Evolutionary Step}
\label{sec:in_progress}

We will release OpenMP 5.0 in November 2018. We have already made 
substantial progress on its content, as TR6~\cite{openmptr6} demonstrates.
Based on TR6, OpenMP 5.0 will increase the page count of the specification 
more than any prior version. However, most new pages will detail additions 
to OpenMP that support performance analysis and debugging tools that we do not
discuss further. Nonetheless, OpenMP 5.0 will also include several extensions 
to the user-level API that significantly enhance its support for a wide 
range of architectures. We now discuss many of those extensions.
