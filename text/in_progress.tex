\section{The Next Evolutionary Step}
\label{sec:in_progress}

We will release OpenMP 5.0 in November 2018. We have already made 
substsantial progress on its content, as TR6~\cite{TR6} demonstrates.
Based on TR6, OpenMP 5.0 will increase the page count of specification 
more than any previous version. However, a large portion of the new
pages will detail additions to OpenMP that support performance analysis
and debugging tools; we will not detail those extensions. Nonetheless,
OpenMP 5.0 will also include several extensions to the user-level API 
that significantly enhance its support for a wide ranging of architectures.
We now discuss many of those extensions.
