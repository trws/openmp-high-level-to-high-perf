\begin{abstract}

This paper presents an overview of the past, present and future
of the OpenMP Application Programming Interface~(API). While the API
originally specified a small set of directives that guided shared 
memory fork-join parallelization of loops and program sections, OpenMP 
now provides a richer set of directives that capture
a wide range of parallelization strategies that are not strictly 
limited to shared memory. As we look towards the future of OpenMP,
we immediately see further evolution of the support for that range 
of parallelization strategies and the addition of direct support for 
debugging and performance analysis tools. Looking beyond the next 
major release of the specification of the OpenMP API, we expect the 
specification eventually to include support for more parallelization
strategies and to embrace closer integration into its Fortran, C and,
in particular, C++ base languages, which will likely require the 
API to adopt additional programming abstractions.
