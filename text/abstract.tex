Heterogeneity continues to increase at all levels of computing, with
the rise of accelerators such as GPUs, FPGAs, and other co-processors
into everything from desktops to supercomputers. As a consequence, 
efficiently managing such disparate resources has become increasingly 
complex.

CoreTSAR seeks to reduce this complexity by
adaptively worksharing parallel-loop regions across compute resources
without requiring any transformation of the code within the loop.  Our
results show performance improvements of up to

three-fold over a current state-of-the-art heterogeneous task
scheduler as well as linear performance scaling from a single 
GPU to four GPUs for many codes.
